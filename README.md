A Comparative Study on Conventional Methods and Machine learning approaches on Stock Market Prediction


INTRODUCTION

In present days so many people's are interested in investing money in stock market for earning more in short period of time. Here ,in stock market consist of many number of company shares along with prices in stock market every minute stock price will changes depending on the company environment and country economic structure decisions. In stock market there are many broker's for handing the stocks buying and selling between the clients and company. In previous year's there is difficult to predict the stock market because lack of technology and knowledge but in present days technology will increases day by day for that we can predict the stock market easily when compare to past here we can predict stock price by analyzing the previous data by using machine learning techniques. From these techniques we can use neural network(it's means that it is interconnected with networking it look like human neural brain structure) and simple moving average method.


IDENTIFICATION OF PROBLEM

The stock market appears in the news every day. You hear about it every time it reaches a new high or a new low. The rate of investment and business opportunities in the Stock market can increase if an efficient algorithm could be devised to predict the short term price of an individual stock. Previous methods of stock predictions involve the use of Artificial Neural Networks and Convolution Neural Networks which has an error loss at an average of 20%. In this report, we will see if there is a possibility of devising a model using Recurrent Neural Network which will predict stock price with a less percentage of error.


IDENTIFICATION OF TASKS

In order to find the model that outperforms other algorithms, we are identifying already available models and analyzing their pros and cons.  We will then work on the models with the data available from trusted sources. This task will be distributed between each member and then combined together.  The next step would be to gather insights from the results and then compare them for best performance.
